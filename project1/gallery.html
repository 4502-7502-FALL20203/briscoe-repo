        <h1>Returning To My Roots</h1>
        <p>I grew up as a summer camp kid. From family weekends as a child to becoming a camper at the age of seven, I spent part of every summer at camp. Althoguh, at some point, life began to change pace, and I lost sight of the importance of my summer camp experiences. This past summer, I returned back to my roots for the first time in nearly seven years. It was a summer to remember, to say the least.</p>

After growing up as a camper and relishing her opportunities to go to The Custard Stand, this was Briscoe’s first time back in nearly seven years. She was so excited to be back, and she hoped to make her campers’ experiences just as memorable as her own<time datetime="2023">2023</time>.

With a population of less than 7000, shopping options in Benton were limited, so Walmart was the one-stop shop for everything during camp. These four girls grew up going to camp together, so they wanted to commemorate being back together<time datetime="2023">2023</time>.
